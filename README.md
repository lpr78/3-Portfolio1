# Friends of Leap Valley

## Purpose

Leap Valley use a [simple site link](
http://www.simplesite.com/friendsofleapvalley/76040428) which is very basic and does not include responsive elements or details relating to the volunteer meeting times, or even sign up procedures for potential support from the local community in South Gloucestershire.  The site offers information regarding Leap Valley for visitors, but lacks the contextual links associated with the TVC (Tutoring Volunteering Community) in Bristol or volunteer meetings.  The previous meetings have lacked potential support from the local community, from failed attempts of using the monthly South Gloucestershire new letters.  

The purpose of the site is to increase the number of volunteers, offering images of the beautiful areas within Leap Valley and volunteering meeting slots, which users are able to sign up, using relevant locators, such as What3Words to assist the potential volunteers of the location of the meeting, within Leap Valley.  The site target audience range from young professionals to the retired community, who want to learn about tending to wildlife across the Leap Valley areas and able to transfer these skills into their own garden and nature.  The site should also emphasis where volunteers can support the recent Guerrilla gardening initiative.  

A range of media will support the sites purpose, with relevant navigation to images, video and text information.  The end result is a form element where volunteers can sign up to a wide-range of volunteer meetings which the main coordinators can use to ascertain number interest and time popularity for future events.

## Deployment and further development ideas

### Deployment
<ul>
<li>The link to the [GitHub File Directory](https://github.com/lpr78/3-Portfolio1) are the working files updated from GitPod </li>
<li>The link to the [Published site](https://lpr78.github.io/3-Portfolio1/) was updated via GitPod and frequently updated to GitHub</li>
</ul>

### Further development
The following ideas could be further developed:
<ul>
<li>Use a modal for map, rather than linking to the image located on the web server</li>
<li>Images could be placed into a scrollable gallery on the about us and members page to save space on the webpage itself</li>
<li>Fix the header at the top of each page to allow the user to reduce scrolling to access the menu</li>
<li>Develop a PHP link that supports the form rather than using the Code Institute POST link</li>
<li>Link the video to a YouTube server and embed, to improve performance score on lighthouse</li>
<li>Use some animated elements on images as long as this does not impact the performance score on the lighthouse</li>
</ul>
