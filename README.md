# Friends of Leap Valley

## Purpose

Leap Valley use a [simple site link](
http://www.simplesite.com/friendsofleapvalley/76040428) which is very basic and does not include responsive elements or details relating to the volunteer meeting times, or even sign up procedures for potential support from the local community in South Gloucestershire.  The site offers information regarding Leap Valley for visitors, but lacks the contextual links associated with the TVC (Tutoring Volunteering Community) in Bristol or volunteer meetings.  The previous meetings have lacked potential support from the local community, from failed attempts of using the monthly South Gloucestershire new letters.  

The purpose of the site is to increase the number of volunteers, offering images of the beautiful areas within Leap Valley and volunteering meeting slots, which users are able to sign up, using relevant locators, such as What3Words to assist the potential volunteers of the location of the meeting, within Leap Valley.  The site target audience range from young professionals to the retired community, who want to learn about tending to wildlife across the Leap Valley areas and able to transfer these skills into their own garden and nature.  The site should also emphasis where volunteers can support the recent Guerrilla gardening initiative.  

A range of media will support the sites purpose, with relevant navigation to images, video and text information.  The end result is a form element where volunteers can sign up to a wide-range of volunteer meetings which the main coordinators can use to ascertain number interest and time popularity for future events.

## Design
### Colors
To keep in the with the style of Leap Valley, i will some high contrasted colours, utilising green as the background and button elements.  They will feature across many features of the website, which will be identified at the point of the iterative development of the website pages.  Hex code values below: 

<img src = "assets/images/README_images/colors.png" width = "550px">

The black and white colours will be used to present the high contrast elements to the design.  Assistance to identify the colours came from using the following [website](https://coolors.co/e6f0e8-b7e8b0-44803b-f8f8ff-000000)

### Typography
The font style used will be a sans serif font.  From research, it is important that the font style is easy and clear to read and utilising this style means it is easier for readers to understand across many different devices.  

Font choices: Hebo and Open Sans.  Both fonts are easy to read with a high contrast.

I will embed the following into the CSS code: @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Heebo&family=Open+Sans&display=swap');

### Call to action
I will use the font styles and colours identified above for the buttons relating to react to the following:
<ol>
<li>Image map button</li>
<li>form button</li>
<li>Google Map link to locate Leap Valley</li>
</ol>

### Icons
I will use [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) to retrieve the following icons across the website:
<ol>
<li>Header: Use a leaf icon to create the logo for Leap Valley Friends</li>
<li>Header Nav: To support a visual representation of the navigational item to support those with reading accessibility needs</li>
<li>Footer: Social Media Icons: Facebook, PInterest, YouTube and Twitter</li>
<li>Footer: Telephone icon: To be able to use VOIP to make contact with TCV and Leap Valley Friends</li>
<li>Contact Us Page: Icons of a calendar, clock and person to support the times of the next volunteering meetings</li>
</ol>

### External Links
I will use relevant links to the following sites:
<ol>
<li>Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, PInterest</li>
<li>Skype link for calling</li>
<li>What3Words site to access exact location of meeting</li>
<li>Gateway Qualification link to support further information on the qualification that can be studied</li>
<li>Link to Conservative Volunteering site that support Friends of Leap Valley</li>
</ol>

### Iteration #1 - Initial Idea on the homepage

The following ideas was developed to see if the actual design ideas were feasible from a high contrast perspective.

<img src = "assets/images/README_images/purpose_section_image.png" width="550px"><br>
At this time i believe the content is suitable, but would need to instruct testers to check the website in the following area:
<ul>
<li>Usability Testing</li>
<li>Readability and Syntax Advisor</li>
<li>Technical Expertise</li>
</ul>

So the following designs will be utilised for the responsive elements of the website:

#### Desktop: 

<table>
<tr><th>Home Page</th><th>Meet Us</th><th>Contact Us</th></tr>
<tr>
<td><img src = "assets/images/wireframe_designs/DESKTOP-Index.png" width = "500px"></td>
<td><img src = "assets/images/wireframe_designs/DESKTOP-Meet.png" width = "500px"></td>

<td><img src = "assets/images/wireframe_designs/TABLET-Contact.png" width = "400px"></td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Mobile:
<table>

## Deployment

### Success Criteria
The following tests will need to be complete throughout development and final testing.
<table>
<tr> <th>Test No</th> <th>Test Actions</th> <th>Test Expectations</th>
</tr>
<tr> <td>1</td> <td>Text should be reable and support accessibility requirements utilising a high contrast with screen resolutions at: 500px, 1500px and 2000px</td> <td> Checking each page of the site, the text should be clear with light on dark or dark on light.</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Checking external navigation links</td><td>Each of the hyperlinks should open on a new page, using a _blank reference</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Clickable Footer icons should work</td><td>All icons should change colour on hover over and should be clickable.  This is for the header and footer elements, such as social media links.</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Interactive google map element in the footter</td><td>The embedded element should be moveable using a mouse action and should be able to display clearly the location of Leap Valley</td></tr>
<tr><td>6</td><td>Video controls</td><td>The video should have appropriate interactive elements that allow the user to play/pause on the Introduction page</td></tr>

### Further development
The following ideas could be further developed:
<ul>
<li>Use a modal for map, rather than linking to the image located on the web server</li>
<li>Images could be placed into a scrollable gallery on the about us and members page to save space on the webpage itself</li>
<li>Fix the header at the top of each page to allow the user to reduce scrolling to access the menu</li>
<li>Develop a PHP link that supports the form rather than using the Code Institute POST link</li>
<li>Link the video to a YouTube server and embed, to improve performance score on lighthouse</li>
<li>Use some animated elements on images as long as this does not impact the performance score on the lighthouse</li>
</ul>
