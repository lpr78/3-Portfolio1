# Friends of Leap Valley

## Purpose

Leap Valley use a [simple site link](
http://www.simplesite.com/friendsofleapvalley/76040428) which is very basic and does not include responsive elements.  The site offers information regarding Leap Valley for visitors, but lacks the contextual links associated with the TVC (Tutoring Volunteering Community) in Bristol.  The purpose of the site is to increase the number of volunteers, offering images of the beautiful sections associated with Leap Valley and volunteering meeting slots, which users are able to sign up, with a What3Words location to assist the potential volunteers of the location of the meeting, within Leap Valley.
