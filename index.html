        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Leap Valley's owned by South Gloucestershire Council and cared for by them and The Friends of Leap Valley. It
            is public land that all can enjoy, even our four-legged family members. It forms part of a wildlife corridor
            linking the River Frome. Leap Valley is located in an urban area, surrounded by houses that cater for
            everyone! There's a children's play area, park, open fields, stream, pond and woodland areas.</p>
        <p>If you are entering from Aintree Drive, there is a children's play park, open space, and a wetland meadow. In
            the summer, this area is buzzing with life, and on sunny days, lots of bees and butterflies and birds can be
            seen feeding on the flowers and enjoy the bug delights in the meadow. We love our recent additions: The
            solitary beehives, bug hotel and birdhouses. Further down the small sloping valley are a small bridge that
            takes you and your pooch across the stream that runs throughout and a freshwater stream to drink from (the
            dogs!). The deep pond is very busy in the summer with horses and dragonflies. This area is woodier and leads
            to open fields.</p>
        <p>If you walk south along the main path, you will soon reach the busy Badminton Road. Cross the road carefully
            and go directly opposite where you will see the other entrance for the second area of Leap Valley. Admire
            our recent additions from our Guerrilla Gardners friends - the Harts-tongue ferns. This area is very
            different, with a path that winds around the outskirts of the woodland, bordering on the nearby housing
            estate. The roads are quiet, though, and you can walk through the woods to maintain social distance from our
            other visits, and you get to hear a range of bird sounds, which is lovely!</p>
        <p>Not all the Nature Reserve is accessible as a non-volunteer. Still, the main paths that run through it are
            suitable for pushchairs and wheelchairs. However, you get to see other wonders (which we will show you in
            our volunteer meeting). We can show you other beautiful Wetland Areas where we are cultivating Western
            swords and Japanese painted ferns. </p>
        <p>We are so grateful to our members, and we tell them every day. Still, we would love more local residence to
            support our local Guerrilla Gardening initiative. For example, we have recently received twelve Horse
            Chestnut saplings that we plan to plant in the BlackTurn Thickets (click on the map below to view). </p>
